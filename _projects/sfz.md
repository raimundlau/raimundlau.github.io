## SFZ in general
The SFZ is an extracurricular program for school students, where they can learn a wide range of knowledge-based MINT topics. Students can learn independently in groups with constant supervision. They can participate in projects such as programming, artificial intelligence (AI), robot programming, model aircraft, and game development. Alternatively, they can bring their own ideas to the free research topic.



## My discipline
Develop, build, and program a robot from scratch to compete in the Rescue Line discipline at the RoboCup Germany. In this competition, robots must follow a line with different obstacles and intersections. During the tournament, each group competes against the others and is ranked based on the robot's ability to complete the course.

## Technical Details
My group started with different starter kits for multiple years and decided to diverge from the mainstream concept of using nearly pre-built robots from LEGO, Fischertechnik, and other providers. We chose to start from scratch. We were aware of the challenges and poor performance in competitions, but considered them secondary to the learning and fun of building and failing.

The robot's base, gripper, and structure were 3D-printed. The base components, such as the motors, chain drive, and display, were bought. We developed the program from scratch in C++.

## Learnings
[x] Work and lead a team
[x] Develop the hardware and software of a robot
[x] Prioritize different development ideas
[x] Participate in the competition and represent the team
[x] Organize sponsors and support for the team
